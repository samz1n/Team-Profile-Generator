# Team-Profile-Generator


## Description 
A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so the scope of this project includes writing a unit test for every part of the code and ensuring that it passes each test.


## Core Objectives Met

1. Following user responses to prompts for team members and their information, an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input. 
2. When a user clicks on an email address in the HTML, their default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
3. When a user clicks on the GitHub username, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
4. When a user starts the application, they are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
5. When a user enters the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number, they are presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building their team.
6. When a user selects the engineer option, then they are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and are taken back to the menu. 
7. When a user selects the intern option, then they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and are taken back to the menu.
8. When a user is finished building their team, then they exit the application and the HTML is generated.
